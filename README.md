# TO Box

This app is an app to help you to apply your moderation rights on a Twitch chat.
The first advantage of this app, is the UI : with it, you'll almost never need to take your keyboard (only for typing reasons of TO/Ban), and you'll never have to write "/timeout", "/ban" or "!permit" anymore, just tap on two buttons.
The second advantage, is the multiple selection : you can ban almost as much users as you want in only one tap (As a moderator, Twitch keeps you to send more than 100 messages/commands per 30 seconds, be sure to send less without what you\'ll be timeout from all Twitch.tv for 30 minutes… I may add an indicator in the next update).
And the last but not least, YOU chose when chat moves (at least on app), and it's useful on very active chatrooms… it prevent from ban random people just because the chat moves too quickly
Last thing: the app shows an object for each users, only the last message is shown, so I encourage you to use it beside your computer without what you'll not see spam…
